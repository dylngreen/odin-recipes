    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Butter</strong>: This classic chocolate chip
                cookie recipe starts with two stick of butter
                creamed with white and brown sugars. The blend
                of sugars creates a perfectly balanced flavor.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Eggs</strong>: Eggs add moisture and act
                as a binding agent, which means they help hold
                the dough together.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Vanilla</strong>: Vanilla extract enhances
                the overall flavor of the chocolate chip cookies.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Baking Soda</strong>: Baking soda acts as a
                leavener, which means it helps the cookies rise.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Water</strong>: A bit of hot water creates steam
                as it bakes, working with the baking soda to puff the 
                cookies up.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors
                of the other ingredients, but it won't make the cookies
                taste salty.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Flour</strong>: All purpose flour helps create
                gluten, which adds structure to the cookie dough.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Chocolate Chips</strong>: Of course, you'll need
                semisweet chocolate chips! You can use dark or milk 
                chocolate chips if you prefer.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Nuts (optional)</strong>: Walnuts are optional, but
                they add nutty flavor and a welcome crunch.
            </li>
        </ul>

         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <ul>
            <li><strong>Spaghetti</strong>:

            should make about eight servings.</li>
            <li><strong>Beef</strong>: 
            You'll need a pound of lean 
            ground beef. You can use a mix of ground beef and
            ground turkey, if you prefer a leaner recipe.</li>
            <li><strong>Spaghetti Sauce</strong>: 
            Use a jar of 
            store-bought spaghetti sauce or <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/11966/best-marinara-sauce-yet/?" target="_blank">

            <li><strong>Cottage Cheese, Cream Cheese, and Sour Cream</strong>:
            A mixture of cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream is 
            essential for this decadent, creamy spaghetti sauce.</li>

            </li>
            <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over 
                medium-high heat. cook and stir beef in the hot skillet

            <li>Transfer to a bowl and mix in spaghetti sauce.
            </li>
            <li>Place 1/2 of the butter slices into the bottom of a 
                9x13-inch casserole dish. Spread 1/2 of the spaghetti
                into the dish.
            </li>
            <li>Mix cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream
                together in a bowl; spread mixture over spaghetti.

                remaining slices of butter

            <li>Pour ground beef mixture over spaghetti
                and spread in an even layer

                Spread Cheddar cheese on top and continue baking until
                cheese has melted and is lightly browned, about
                15 minutes more.
